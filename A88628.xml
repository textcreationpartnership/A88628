            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Nicolas</hi> of <hi>Ienvile</hi> (a young man) was condemned to die; and being Å¿et in a Cart, his father came with a Å¿taff, and would have beaten him; but the Officers would not Å¿uffer him: at which, the Å¿on cries to the Officers to let his father alone, Å¿aying he had power over him to do in that kinde what he would: but ChriÅ¿t was dearer to him then his deareÅ¿t friend on earth.</p>
            <p>Hence it was, that <hi>Hierome</hi> Å¿aid, that if his father were weeping on his knees before him, his mother hung cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his neck behind him, and all his brethren, Å¿iÅ¿ters, children, kinsfolks, howling on every Å¿ide on him; he'd fling them all to the ground, deÅ¿piÅ¿e all his kindred, run over his father, tread under his mother, to run to ChriÅ¿t and his CauÅ¿e, though on the CroÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>And what? Å¿hall our bowels be Å¿hut up to bleÅ¿Å¿ed JeÅ¿us, and his <hi>crucified CauÅ¿e,</hi> at this time of day?

               <hi>Thus Å¿aith the Lord, Behold, I will lay Å¿tumbling-blocks before this people, and the fathers and the Å¿ons together Å¿hall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend Å¿hall periÅ¿h.</hi> Offences and Å¿tumbling-blocks are <hi>periÅ¿hing</hi> Judgements; Vials full of wrath, that bring WO upon the world.</p>
            <p>It concerns us to enquire, whether <hi>the Age we live in</hi> be not one of thoÅ¿e times, wherein God is provoked to Å¿uch great wrath, as to <hi>lay Å¿tumbling-blocks before our feet,</hi> that we may fall upon them, and periÅ¿h: If Å¿o, then how extraordinary wary ought we to be in all our ways, <hi>leÅ¿t we take offence</hi> at Christ and his Truth? Many times the Truth is not diÅ¿pens'd in Å¿uch away nor maner, nor by Å¿uch perÅ¿ons as we expect; and then how ready are we to caÅ¿t it aÅ¿ide, and trample on it, and embrace a Lye (becauÅ¿e it's Å¿utable to us) in Å¿tead of Truth? BecauÅ¿e when ChriÅ¿t firÅ¿t came, the maner of his coming was Å¿o contrary to their expectations; when they expected he Å¿hould fill the Palaces of this world with his glory, behold, <hi>he is born in a Stable;</hi> they are offended at him, they Å¿tumble and fall, to the periÅ¿hing of their Å¿ouls.

doating people, in the worlds account, and a company of Å¿hepherds: he came in a way they leaÅ¿t dream'd on. And if we Å¿earch the Scriptures, we Å¿hall finde that God hath diÅ¿pens'd his Truth (moÅ¿tly) in Å¿uch ways and by Å¿uch inÅ¿truments as were moÅ¿t deÅ¿picable in the eye of man's wiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>a Å¿tumbling-block to the Jew, fooliÅ¿hneÅ¿s to the Greek.</hi>

               <hi>2.</hi> The end of all is, <hi>The glory of God;</hi> that God may have great glory out of this confuÅ¿ion. How doth it tend to the glory and honour of God, that Å¿uch <hi>mean deÅ¿piÅ¿ed</hi> men, as <hi>herds-men, gatherers of Å¿ycomore-fruit, fiÅ¿her-men, and Publicanes,</hi> Å¿hould be enabled by the Spirit of God to demonÅ¿trate and lay open to men the inviÅ¿ible things of God, the deep myÅ¿teries and Å¿ecrets of his love and rich grace? The leÅ¿s of man, the more of God appears. When once God works upon a man, to the giving of him a true knowledge of things, how glorious is it in his eye? That God Å¿hould condeÅ¿cend Å¿o lowe, to Å¿uch mean crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and do Å¿uch great things by Å¿o unlikely means, wonderful doth God then appear in the glory of all his attributes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118848:5"/>If Å¿o, how much doth it concern me and thee, to lie continually at the throne of Grace, that not the FirÅ¿t of theÅ¿e, but the Second may be wrought in us? O then, let us <hi>take heed of Offences,</hi> both of giving and taking offences. <hi>Wo to the world becauÅ¿e of offences: it muÅ¿t needs be that offences come; but wo to him by whom offences come: it were better for him, that a milÅ¿tone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the Å¿ea.</hi> And what great offence is it, both to the world, and to the lambs of ChriÅ¿t, for any who have profeÅ¿t the Truth, to betray it, and flinch back from it, when they Å¿ee the Å¿un likely to burn hot, loÅ¿s and perÅ¿ecution in this world like to come? But this is a digreÅ¿sion: my Work is to intreat of my Reader to beware of TAKING offence. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences may be Å¿oon taken, but they are not Å¿o Å¿oon gotten away. It's a hard and difficult thing to cloÅ¿e with a Truth, when once we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared our offence at it. God will do <hi>Wonders in the world,</hi> Å¿uch as never were known nor heard of before, as will make <hi>mens ears to tingle:</hi> when we Å¿ee Å¿uch things a doing, let us have a care of <hi>being offended,</hi> leÅ¿t we Å¿tumble, and fall, and periÅ¿h, upon our own Å¿tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks, which by our <hi>offences</hi> we lay before our own feet.</p>
            <p>If God Å¿hould totally withdraw himÅ¿elf from, and lay aÅ¿ide (the preÅ¿ent Å¿elf-Å¿eeking, apoÅ¿tatizing Clergie, as at ChriÅ¿t's firÅ¿t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he caÅ¿t off the Clergie of the JewiÅ¿h Church, that were grown depraved, and hypocritically wicked) that generation of men, which he hath uÅ¿ed Å¿o long a time, to diÅ¿penÅ¿e his Word and Will by, and go once more among the <hi>Publicanes, FiÅ¿hermen,</hi> and <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> to Å¿eek out and take from among them fit inÅ¿truments for his glory, (the more contemptible and vile they are in themÅ¿elvs, the fitter for his uÅ¿e) let us not be <hi>offended.</hi> Judge nothing before we have try'd it: <hi>Try the Å¿pirits, whether they be of God or no: To the Law, and to the TeÅ¿timony;</hi> if they prove not according to that Rule, then we may Å¿afely excommunicate them our hearts. But have a care, <hi>take heed;</hi> there are many voices in the world; we may Å¿oon be deceived. It's a Å¿pecial character of ChriÅ¿t's Å¿heep, That they <hi>now his own voice from a Å¿trangers voice; and a Å¿tranger they will not follow.</hi> ChriÅ¿t is <hi>raiÅ¿ing his voice,</hi> and calls aloud to his people to prepare for his coming, and gives many Å¿ignes of his nigh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>pproach. And the devil <hi>raiÅ¿es his voice</hi> too, and transforms himÅ¿elf into a glorious angel of light. If <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> do Å¿trange and wonderful things, the Magicians will do Å¿o too. The cry and voice of the kingdom of ChriÅ¿t is up, and begins to riÅ¿e high; and Satan
<pb facs="tcp:118848:6"/>
raiÅ¿es many (confuÅ¿ed) voices, to Å¿tifle that cry; that through the noiÅ¿e and din that he makes about the ears of mens Å¿ouls, they may not hear, and believe, and be Å¿aved. Therefore now it behoves us to have a great care leÅ¿t we be deceived, to Å¿earch and try every thing, ere we receive it as truth: but above all, take heed of <hi>being offended,</hi> leÅ¿t we prove <hi>offended at the Truth,</hi> and Å¿o periÅ¿h; for that is that, at which we are moÅ¿t apt to be offended. If there be one Truth incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred about with (through AntichriÅ¿tian fogs and miÅ¿ts) a hundred Errours, a thouÅ¿and to one (if we take not great heed) we Å¿hall paÅ¿s all thoÅ¿e errours with a favourable conÅ¿truction, (at leaÅ¿t) and be offended at that <hi>one Truth;</hi> and Å¿o Å¿tumble, and fall foul on it: and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows then? PERISHING, Wo.</p>
            <p>As for this TreatiÅ¿e, I Å¿hall onely Å¿ay thus much: It might have been enlarged, and many things further proved and illuÅ¿trated; but I deÅ¿ired brevity for thy accommodation: and knowing how well thou loveÅ¿t thy money, I was loth to intrench too much upon thy purÅ¿e. Read it over conÅ¿iderately, and compare one thing with another; and I Å¿uppoÅ¿e thou wilt Å¿ee a line of truth going thorow it, and Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may deÅ¿erve laying up in our hearts, and pondering. If we do hearken to the truth in it, we may poÅ¿Å¿ibly finde the way to get Å¿uch a frame of heart, as may free us from the bitterneÅ¿s of that Cup, which the Author of this book fears may be the porton of this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to drink the dregs of. Onely, I intreat thee again, <hi>beware of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences;</hi> they are the ready way to deÅ¿truction: there's no hope in that path, but that which is periÅ¿hing. And let me adde this, That he that takes offence not given, is both the giver and the taker of the offence; and then, what MILL-STONES OF WRATH may he expect, to grinde him to powder?</p>
            <p>Now the good Lord teach thee and me to know the voice of Christ (the true Shepherd) from a Å¿trangers voice, and follow him alone, and fully. <hi>Farewel.</hi>

LikeneÅ¿s in Å¿in and wickedneÅ¿s, brings likeneÅ¿s in afflictions and publiÅ¿hments. Times paÅ¿t Å¿eem to be a type or figure of the preÅ¿ent, and the preÅ¿ent to be a re-acting or doing over again thoÅ¿e things (either more clearly, or more obÅ¿curely) that the former times brought forth. ViciÅ¿Å¿itudes and changes are Å¿utable to the mutable nature of Man. What one Age doth or builds up, another undoes or pulls down; a third comes, and would reform all if they could tell how: yet Å¿till it's but like the hand of a Dyal, that goes from One to Twelve and then to One again. There is <hi>no new thing under the Å¿un.</hi> Nothing can properly be Å¿aid to be new, but the new creature: the works of God and of the Spirit of God are new but the works and ways of men are old; at beÅ¿t, but <hi>new images of old things:</hi> and all <hi>old things muÅ¿t paÅ¿s away;</hi> nothing will be durable, till <hi>all things become new; new heavens, new earth.</hi> TheÅ¿e three parts of time, <hi>paÅ¿t, preÅ¿ent,</hi> and <hi>to come,</hi> are very nigh of kin: they are Å¿o like each other, that they may well be taken for brethren. An indifferent Judgement Å¿tudying the times paÅ¿t, may caÅ¿t the waters, and give a true Judgement of the preÅ¿ent; and a prudent eye may by the Å¿ame rule be able to give a Å¿hrewd gheÅ¿s at the times to come, eÅ¿pecially times nigh, or next at hand. ThoÅ¿e who make <hi>Cornelius Tacitus, Titus Livius</hi> or other Romane Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, their GoÅ¿pel, will tell us, that <hi>Julius, AuguÅ¿tus,</hi> and <hi>Tiberius CaeÅ¿ar</hi>'s parts are acting over again in the world by other perÅ¿ons, and under another Vizard: and I could heartily wiÅ¿h, that they had not Å¿o much ground as they have for their conjecture.</p>

               <p>The people of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> groan'd under the hand of their oppreÅ¿Å¿ors as you may read in the Å¿tory of <hi>Naboth;</hi> and they were compel'd to worÅ¿hip idols in Å¿tead of the true God, the beÅ¿t whereof were <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams calves,</hi> (characteriÅ¿tically called <hi>his Å¿ins</hi>) and the more groÅ¿s were <hi>Baal,</hi> and other the gods of the heathens. Now the Prophet gives <hi>Iehu</hi> full commiÅ¿Å¿ion to execute the vengeance of God upon theÅ¿e Tyrants, the enemies of God nad his people, as you may read in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>The other part of the CauÅ¿e, to wit, deliverance and liberty for the

people of God to worÅ¿hip the true God, is plainly intimated in Chap. 10. verÅ¿. 31. <hi>But Iehu took no heed</hi> &amp;c. God expected he Å¿hould walk uprightly before him, as <hi>David</hi> did: wherefore did God give him commiÅ¿Å¿ion to make the houÅ¿e of <hi>Ahab</hi> like to the houÅ¿e of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> but to let him know that he expected his turning from <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>'s Å¿ins as well as <hi>Ahab</hi>'s; and that he Å¿hould take away the peoples oppreÅ¿Å¿ions and bondage in matters of WorÅ¿hip as well as in their outward eÅ¿tate? Yea one reaÅ¿on why God would have <hi>Ahab</hi> thus dealt with is, that he might <hi>avenge the blood of the prophets;</hi> which blood was Å¿hed in defence of the true WorÅ¿hip of God. And what was it that made God Å¿o wroth with <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>BaaÅ¿ha,</hi> but becauÅ¿e they <hi>made IÅ¿rael to Å¿in</hi> by compelling them to forÅ¿ake the true God and his WorÅ¿hip? 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.9 10. and 16.2.3. So that it's clear, that the cauÅ¿e <hi>Iehu</hi> had the managing of, was, <hi>the execution of God's wrath,</hi> and <hi>deliverance of his people from all bondage and oppreÅ¿Å¿ions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a neer affinity there is between this CauÅ¿e of God in theÅ¿e times of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> and the CauÅ¿e this preÅ¿ent generation have had the managing of, for theÅ¿e many yeers laÅ¿t paÅ¿t; yea, that it's one and the Å¿ame is Å¿o obvious to every Å¿erious eye, that it would be but time loÅ¿t to bring arguments to prove it.</p>

of Baal. Jehu</hi> was now at a Å¿tand; he knew not what to do, to root out all the PrieÅ¿ts and worÅ¿hippers of <hi>Baal:</hi> he knew well enough, that he could not be Å¿ecure in his Throne, if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Land, and he forÅ¿ake <hi>Baal;</hi> they would remember their old friend <hi>Ahab,</hi> and avenge his death, if by any means they could accompliÅ¿h it: and he might think too, that if he performed not the chief ends of God, God would remove him himÅ¿elf: and Å¿ome Å¿parks of light of conÅ¿cience might tell him, it was his duty, and one chief end why God had anointed him King, that he might deÅ¿troy <hi>Baal</hi> out of IÅ¿rael. But it was his corrupt and deceitful heart, that drew him to play the hypocrite, and diÅ¿Å¿emble.

And what was this good piece of policie but to play the hypocritical diÅ¿Å¿embler? In verÅ¿. 18. <hi>Ahab Å¿erved Baal a little, but Iehu Å¿hall Å¿erve him much. Jehu</hi> was acquainted with that Princely Maxime, <hi>Qui neÅ¿cit diÅ¿Å¿imulare, neÅ¿cit regnare:</hi> He that knows not how to diÅ¿Å¿emble, knows not how to reign. <hi>Ahab Å¿erved Baal a little;</hi> he gave a little encouragement to his worÅ¿hip, prieÅ¿ts, and worÅ¿hippers, Å¿mall gifts and riches: it may be, to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, or here and there Å¿ome eminent man, he would give largely. <hi>But I will Å¿erve him much;</hi> I will have all to taÅ¿te of my fatneÅ¿s, and feel of my warmth, enjoy the benefit of my good-will to <hi>Baal:</hi> they Å¿hall all be the better for me: thoÅ¿e that could not live on the Å¿hort commons of their Tythes and Oblations, Å¿hall now have more.</p>

And now <hi>he proclaims a Å¿olemn aÅ¿Å¿embly</hi> of all thoÅ¿e idolatrous worÅ¿hippers of <hi>Baal,</hi> and he Å¿ends thorow all IÅ¿rael, that none might be wanting; for he would make a great feaÅ¿t for <hi>Baal.</hi> So that by this, he Å¿et them on Å¿uch work, as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them for Å¿laughter and deÅ¿truction: they muÅ¿t <hi>offer Å¿acrifices to

               <p>Fourth place, Let us view <hi>Iehu,</hi> this mighty man, <hi>in his zeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O how gloriouÅ¿ly zealous is he! full of zeal and good works: his heart Å¿eems on fire for God and his glory: <hi>not one tittle of the word of the Lord Å¿hall fall to the ground:</hi> he will Å¿lay all that belongs to the houÅ¿e of <hi>Ahab; not leave a man to paÅ¿s againÅ¿t the wall:</hi> and, as hath been before obÅ¿erved, he will deliver the people of God fully from their oppreÅ¿Å¿ions, and take off every heavie yoke. But let us view the particulars wherein his zeal Å¿hews it Å¿elf Å¿o ominouÅ¿ly.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t <hi>againÅ¿t the Å¿ins and wickedneÅ¿s of the times.</hi> When he met <hi>Joram,</hi> Å¿aith the King <hi>Is it peace Jehu?</hi> Peace? Å¿aith he, <hi>What peace Å¿o long as the whoredoms &amp; witchcrafts of thy mother Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel are Å¿o many?</hi> Peace belongs not to thee; no peace with thy abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations: I will not Å¿heath my Å¿word until I have deÅ¿troyed all thoÅ¿e OppreÅ¿Å¿ions in the State and Innovations in the Church,<note place="margin">Was not this our practice in our firÅ¿t motions?</note> that have provoked God to wrath againÅ¿t the Land, and hindered the people from worÅ¿hipping the true God. What peace with <hi>Ahab?</hi> peace with <hi>Iezebel?</hi> No: you Å¿hall know I am raiÅ¿ed up and inÅ¿pired by God to avenge the blood of his Å¿ervants upon your heads correct your tyrannies and deÅ¿troy the cauÅ¿e of them out of the Land: I will not withdraw my hand, until I have purged the Land from all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118848:11"/>
thoÅ¿e things that pollute it; and <hi>CurÅ¿ed be he that withholdeth his hand from Å¿hedding of blood.</hi> Well Å¿aid, <hi>Iehu;</hi> thou art hot now, but <hi>thou wilt be cool enough anon, when thine own turn is Å¿erv'd: when thou haÅ¿t done as much as is needful for thy own deÅ¿ignes, then thou wilt let Gods work go whither it will for thee: they are fools and aÅ¿Å¿es that mind THEN any thing more, then Å¿etling the State in peace and quiet, that they may enjoy the fruits of their labours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, his zeal puts forth it Å¿elf in this: <hi>He would not have one to remain alive of Baals prieÅ¿ts;</hi> he would kill them all every mothers childe: yea <hi>whoÅ¿oever let one of them eÅ¿cape his life Å¿hould go for it.</hi> But have a care <hi>Iehu, thou art not at laÅ¿t as furious againÅ¿t the Lords own Prophets, as thou art now againÅ¿t Baals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, his zeal appears in this,<note place="margin">TheÅ¿e things have been done viÅ¿ibly before our eyes.</note> That <hi>he brake down all the images of Baal, and brake down the houÅ¿e of Baal and made it a draught houÅ¿e.</hi> How zealous was this man for God! one would have thought that Å¿urely this man liv'd in heaven, and his thoughts were always upon JeruÅ¿alem, and his heart thitherward.

               <p>In the fifth place let us view him in <hi>his profeÅ¿Å¿ion:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>he profeÅ¿t him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf to be one <hi>that Å¿tudyed much the minde and will of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate all his actions by that model he had received from God by his Prophets: Thus Å¿aith the Lord, This is the word of the Lord;</hi> as you may obÅ¿erve all along the hiÅ¿tory. When he met the King, what was the profeÅ¿Å¿ion he made, but that his work was the rooting out all thoÅ¿e abominations that had provoked the Lord to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? <hi>What peace, Å¿o long as the whoredoms and witchcrafts are Å¿o many?</hi> When he had Å¿lain <hi>Ioram,</hi> he profeÅ¿t he did nothing but what he was commanded of the Lord: <hi>CaÅ¿t him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Iezreelite: for remember how that when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father the Lord laid this burden upon him,</hi> &amp;c. He would have a Word for all his actions;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118848:12"/>
and nothing would he Å¿eem to do,<note place="margin">This is a true and compleat Character of Å¿ome in theÅ¿e our reforming times.</note> but what was conÅ¿onant to the minde and will of the Lord. Again, when he had Å¿lain <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and Å¿he was eaten by the dogs, what application did he make? It was the will of the Lord: <hi>This is the word of the Lord which he Å¿pake by his Å¿ervant Elijah the TiÅ¿hbite, Å¿aying,</hi> &amp;c. O heavenly man! whoÅ¿e tongue is tipt with Scripture, the experiences of the Saints, and the Revelations of the Prophets. When he had Å¿ubtilly cauÅ¿ed the Å¿eventy Å¿ons of <hi>Ahab</hi> to be Å¿lain, what was the concluÅ¿ion? That the people Å¿hould know, <hi>that nothing of the word of the Lord Å¿hould fall unto the earth, which he had Å¿poken by Elijah, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Ahab.</hi> And when he met with <hi>Iehonadab,</hi> what was his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion, but to be <hi>zealous for God?</hi> What a profeÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿incerity and plainneÅ¿s of heart in the cauÅ¿e of God did he make? How cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious was he of his aÅ¿Å¿ociates and companions? He would have none but Å¿uch as were like himÅ¿elf, holy men in appearance. <hi>If thy heart be right as my heart, come and Å¿ee my zeal for the Lord,</hi> (be my companions) otherwiÅ¿e not. By the way, obÅ¿erve how poor <hi>Iehu</hi> praiÅ¿es himÅ¿elf: <hi>if thy heart be right, as my heart:</hi> he praiÅ¿es his own Å¿incerity his zeal (<hi>come and Å¿ee my zeal</hi> there's none like mine) his grace, his conformity to the will of God, his performance of the Word of the Lord, the effects of the Spirit upon his heart; O none like his! Surely he had forgot <hi>Solomon</hi>'s counÅ¿el, <hi>Let a Å¿tranger praiÅ¿e thee.</hi> And did not that PhariÅ¿ee write by this copie, that Å¿aid, <hi>Lord I thank thee, that I am not as that Publicane is?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iehu</hi> was a great Preacher too: whether he were in the field, or in the palace, or in the gate of the city, he was always preaching, as the Å¿tory mentions: <hi>This is the word of the Lord; Remember what the Lord Å¿aid</hi> &amp;c. He Å¿eem'd as if he could Å¿peak no other language but the words of God. NotwithÅ¿tanding all this, <hi>he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not in the law of the Lord with all his heart.</hi>

               <p>Sixthly, Let us view him <hi>in his hypocriÅ¿ie:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How cloÅ¿e a hypocrite was this Å¿eeming-heavenly <hi>Iehu!</hi> Who could diÅ¿cern him to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, till he came to the touch? He had as fair an outÅ¿ide as ever man had: yet he was <hi>as a whited Å¿epulchre, full of dead mens bones within;</hi> nothing but corruption and deceit lodging in his heart.</p>
               <p>This man's <hi>hypocriÅ¿ie</hi> appeared clearly, in his <hi>dealing with Baal and his prieÅ¿ts,</hi> playing the counterfeit and diÅ¿Å¿embler with them. Now what a caÅ¿e may we think the poor people of God were in, in this time of temptation and trouble? what could they do, but make their complaints to their all-Å¿eeing God and Father, who they knew
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118848:12"/>
would hear their Å¿ighs and groans,<note place="margin">Is not this the caÅ¿e now diÅ¿pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in theÅ¿e our diÅ¿Å¿embling times?</note> and give an anÅ¿wer full of grace and love? Well, but when he had diÅ¿covered himÅ¿elf but to diÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with <hi>Baal</hi> and his PrieÅ¿ts, and to mean otherwiÅ¿e then he at that time pretended, how could he Å¿hift off the guilt of hypocriÅ¿ie before the people of God, who knew, by the experience they had of their own hearts, that it could not Å¿tand with a Å¿incere Å¿pirit, with Water-men to look one way and row another? Why he had <hi>his Iehonadabs with him,</hi> that had a great reputation and eÅ¿teem, for their holineÅ¿s and Å¿anctity among the people, to plead his cauÅ¿e, and tell them. His meaning and end was good, and that it was a wiÅ¿e courÅ¿e; for by this means he prevented further oppoÅ¿ition that in all likelihood would be made, (for many of the people, without queÅ¿tion, did cleave to them; and he knew he Å¿hould finde it a more difficult thing to root out <hi>Baal</hi> and his PrieÅ¿ts, then <hi>Ahab</hi>'s poÅ¿terity. SuperÅ¿tition makes the heart more Å¿tout, and Å¿ets upon more hazardous and deÅ¿perate attempts, then love to a King or Prince will) and Å¿o, in the quarrel, the blood of Å¿ome others of the people might be Å¿hed, which were not appointed to deÅ¿truction. It's a good and commendable thing, to prevent Å¿hedding of innocent blood; and it's a courÅ¿e of quick diÅ¿patch too, drawing them into a Å¿nare altogether, doing that at once, which would otherwiÅ¿e take up a great deal of time, trouble and difficulty to do; and Å¿o, in Å¿tead of furthering the work of God, prevent it, and make it longer in the birth, by creating new troubles and new diÅ¿turbances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people: and if there were a failing in the way to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliÅ¿hing that good end, why failings are incident to the beÅ¿t of men, and nothing can be expected perfect here in this world, to come from men. Excellently pleaded, <hi>Iehonadab!</hi> thou Å¿halt have two Crowns (or a flap with a Fox tail) when <hi>Iehu</hi> is Å¿etled in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for thy great and faithful Å¿ervices. Thus they skin over the Å¿ore, that it appears not to every eye. Well, <hi>Iehu,</hi> but this will not Å¿erve thy turn; thy hypocriÅ¿ie will be made evident by and by, and God will diÅ¿cover thy nakedneÅ¿s, and thou Å¿halt know what it is to Å¿in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t and provoke the God of heaven and earth to great jealouÅ¿ie and wrath, who hath done Å¿o much for thee, and exalted thee from the duÅ¿t, to govern his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A full diÅ¿covery of this man's hypocriÅ¿ie and apoÅ¿tatizing heart,</hi> we have in the words we have choÅ¿en mainly to inÅ¿iÅ¿t upon, and that by undeniable demonÅ¿trations. When the peoples expectations were full and high, and there wanted nothing but a command or licenÅ¿e for their going up to JeruÅ¿alem to worÅ¿hip; behold! the golden Calves Å¿tood in the way, and hindered.</p>

               <p>Poor <hi>Jehu</hi> could go no further: in Å¿tead of going to the true God, he runs to his golden Calves, and takes up his reÅ¿ting-place there: Why? becauÅ¿e that notwithÅ¿tanding all his glorious outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he had not the root of the matter in him; and his heart not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a heavenly nature, what Å¿hould he do there, or in the ways that lead effectually to it?

               <p>Indeed, <hi>Iehu</hi> went as far as can be expected for a hypocrite to do: he went to the very borders of heaven; there was <hi>but one thing wanting: he could not overcome his worldly intereÅ¿t, and live by faith upon God for the diÅ¿poÅ¿al of that;</hi> and Å¿o he made this world his god: all that provok'd God Å¿hould go down, but that: <hi>BaaÅ¿ha</hi>'s and <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Å¿ins too; but when once <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s Å¿in came to be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that touch'd him to the quick; it was of Å¿o neer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as he thought) to his kingdom.

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief will carry a man, though he be never Å¿o outwardly glorious in profeÅ¿Å¿ion, to the greateÅ¿t precipices of apoÅ¿tatizing danger.</p>
               <p>And is not this <hi>the very picture of our times?</hi> How zealous were we many years for God! and pull'd down all before us that Å¿tood in our way: we pull'd down and utterly deÅ¿troyed <hi>Ahab and his whole houÅ¿e and left none remaining:</hi> but now we are gotten to the Calves and alas, <hi>they are golden ones,</hi> have a great deal of good (gold) in them; it's pity to deÅ¿troy them.

Why, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ooth, they will tell you it's reaÅ¿on of State, to prevent an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary unpreÅ¿idented evil that hangs over our heads, ready to fall upon us: and Å¿uch muÅ¿t have extraordinary and unuÅ¿ual remedies, otherwiÅ¿e <hi>the Ant will be too hard for the Lion,</hi> and his power, majeÅ¿tie, and great glory, will be tumbled into the duÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>But <hi>what became of all this policie?</hi> what was <hi>the fruit of it?</hi> why <hi>it brought ruine upon him and his houÅ¿e,</hi> as the Å¿tory evidences. <hi>He that Å¿eeks his life, Å¿hall loÅ¿e it:</hi> by the very Å¿ame evil ways that men take to Å¿ecure themÅ¿elves in their Å¿tate, their ruine Å¿hall inevitably come; all their craft and cunning Å¿hall not be able to prevent it. <hi>Iehu</hi> kept his kingdom for a while; but he was not beholden one jot to his wicked policie for it, but to the abundant mercy of God, who would not let him go unrewarded for his Å¿o great Å¿ervice, in deÅ¿troying the houÅ¿e of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Baal</hi> out of IÅ¿rael: <hi>BecauÅ¿e thou haÅ¿t done that which is right in mine eyes,</hi> &amp;c. he Å¿hould have the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the fourth generation, a little while: and what comes then? nothing but utter ruine and deÅ¿truction. <hi>And the Lord Å¿aid unto him,</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:118848:14"/>FirÅ¿t, Idolatry; withdrawing the people from the true God, telling them that the golden calves were their Gods that brought them out of the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Secondly, Putting the true PrieÅ¿ts from their Å¿ervice, and making PrieÅ¿ts or MiniÅ¿ters of the loweÅ¿t of the people. Thirdly, DeviÅ¿ing a new worÅ¿hip for theÅ¿e calves, their golden Gods.</p>
               <p>For the firÅ¿t, <hi>IDOLATRY;</hi> A Å¿in Å¿o <hi>provoking unto God,</hi> as that it had coÅ¿t the <hi>IÅ¿raelites</hi> their <hi>utter ruine</hi> at their firÅ¿t commiÅ¿Å¿ion of it, had they not had a faithful Mediator to plead their cauÅ¿e with God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10, 11. a Å¿in that deprived them of <hi>the preÅ¿ence of God,</hi> Exod. 33.3. a Å¿in againÅ¿t which there is <hi>Å¿o much wrath of God</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by all the Prophets, and of which God had much complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how it <hi>grieved his holy Spirit, and provok'd him to anger;</hi> yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would warn <hi>Jeroboam</hi> nor <hi>Jehu,</hi> but for the love of this world, the honours &amp; vanities thereof, they would Å¿tick by it, &amp; no perÅ¿waÅ¿ion would move them to depart from it: <hi>Behold Å¿aith Jeroboam, thy Gods, O IÅ¿rael,</hi> &amp;c. as if he had Å¿aid (and <hi>Jehu</hi>'s actions Å¿pake the Å¿ame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) theÅ¿e Calves had wrought thoÅ¿e wonderful revolutions as had then happened to <hi>IÅ¿rael;</hi> that there was no more of a deity manifeÅ¿ted in them then was in theÅ¿e calves: a prophane Å¿peech making it evident, <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s God was the God of this world; the Devil having Å¿hewn him the glory of this world he falls down &amp; worÅ¿hips him, that Å¿o it may be his portion to enjoy it: thus <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and Å¿o <hi>Iehu</hi> drew the people from their God, by preaching to them (when their expectations were raiÅ¿ed high &amp; great after their going up to <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> to worÅ¿hip, and that upon apprehenÅ¿ions of an Almighty and extraordinary providence of God, bringing things Å¿o marvelouÅ¿ly about &amp; giving Å¿uch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Å¿ucceÅ¿s to their proceedings) that this apprehenÅ¿ion of theirs was but a fancy; as great things had been done for &amp; by others as theÅ¿e, and as great revolutions had been made in the world in times of old, and yet all things remain as you Å¿ee, as at the beginning; and by Å¿uch-like Arguments as theÅ¿e, perÅ¿wade the people from their belief of the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency and faithfulneÅ¿s of God in performing his promiÅ¿es, and Å¿o bring them by this means to Å¿ubmit to their innovations and uÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, being thus blinded, not being able to Å¿ee by faith God's making bare his arm, bending his bow, Å¿harpening his arrows, and whetting his Å¿word to fulfil his promiÅ¿es made to his choÅ¿en ones: And Å¿urely, it's too too evident, that we are (after theÅ¿e mens exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) running to our old Idolatry, onely new gilded over with Å¿pecious pretences, and under another form; the Å¿erpent the old dragon having furniÅ¿hed us with a new mold to caÅ¿t our Image in, and helping us by his wiÅ¿dom to bring our old calves into the new faÅ¿hion: <hi>If we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118848:15"/>
have done all that God hath commanded, what means this bleating of the Å¿heep, and lowing of the oxen?</hi> no: but in Å¿tead of pulling down and taking away the remainders of Idolatry, we are Å¿etting up new Idols under other and more Å¿pecious pretences: every way of our <hi>own invention,</hi> though it be never Å¿o good in it Å¿elf, to never Å¿o righteous an end, yet if it be not of Gods appointment, it's Idolatry, it's Å¿uperÅ¿tition, will-worÅ¿hip, and it may juÅ¿tly be asked, <hi>Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired this at your hands?</hi> Å¿urely God did not, but your Idolatrous calviÅ¿h hearts, that are full of many inventions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Taking <hi>away the true MiniÅ¿ters of God in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, and making other PrieÅ¿ts of the loweÅ¿t of the people;</hi> this was another of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> heinous Å¿ins, that <hi>Jehu</hi> departed not from: having taken away the worÅ¿hip of God, he takes away his MiniÅ¿ters too: he puts the <hi>Levites</hi> away from performing that Å¿ervice God had appointed them to in his worÅ¿hip; and having inÅ¿tituted a new worÅ¿hip of his own deviÅ¿ing, he conÅ¿titutes new MiniÅ¿ters and PrieÅ¿ts to Å¿erve in that worÅ¿hip.</p>
               <p>QueÅ¿t. If it be asked, <hi>How I can Å¿ay this is a reÅ¿emblance of our times? Å¿urely we have learned and high-minded MiniÅ¿ters, that minde high things;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> If ever there were a time wherein the loweÅ¿t of the people were made MiniÅ¿ters in the worÅ¿hip of God, it's now. I confeÅ¿s it (and that with joy) there are many (conÅ¿idered by themÅ¿elves) precious holy Å¿ervants of the Lord, true MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pel in this our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>England;</hi> but by that time theÅ¿e great Kings, <hi>whoredome, drunkenneÅ¿s, Å¿wearing, lying, covetouÅ¿neÅ¿s</hi> (eating the poors bread) <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> have ranged their Å¿ubjects under their banners from among the MiniÅ¿ters of <hi>England,</hi> the remaining num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber will be Å¿o few, that (I fear) God will hardly have his Tythe duely Å¿et out: and if theÅ¿e be not of the loweÅ¿t of the people, I know not who are. The truth of theÅ¿e things is Å¿o obvious to every man, that I Å¿uppoÅ¿e it's not required of me to prove this great charge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Å¿ins, that <hi>Iehu</hi> would not depart from, was, <hi>his deviÅ¿ing new wayes of worÅ¿hip;</hi> and that as like the true worÅ¿hip of God, as his received worldly principles and intereÅ¿t would permit him, whereby to take the hearts of the people, and draw them after him the more. Though he would have a worÅ¿hip as like Gods worÅ¿hip as poÅ¿Å¿ible might be, yet <hi>Gods</hi> worÅ¿hip he would not have, becauÅ¿e he thought it contrary to his worldly intereÅ¿t: <hi>O,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>now Å¿hall the kingdom return to the houÅ¿e of David: if
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118848:15"/>
this people go up to do Å¿acrifice in the houÅ¿e of the Lord at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem, then Å¿hall the hearts of this people return again unto their King even unto Rehoboam, and they Å¿hall kill me:</hi> But, Å¿aith <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> I will prevent that by my wiÅ¿dom and policie, I will have <hi>new Gods,</hi> and <hi>new WorÅ¿hip,</hi> and <hi>new PrieÅ¿ts,</hi> and Å¿uffer not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to go up to <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> to worÅ¿hip. If the peoples worÅ¿hipping the true God according to his own appointments, will in his apprehenÅ¿ion hinder his enjoyment of his outward worldly intereÅ¿t, then farewel PrieÅ¿ts, worÅ¿hip, and God too; I will finde out new wayes of my own deviÅ¿ing, that Å¿hall be as bulwarks to Å¿ecure my Å¿tate, and compel the people to walk in them; and if any dare rebuke my doings, I'll ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>the withering of mine arm by Å¿tretching it out againÅ¿t them.</hi> But Å¿tay, for all your haÅ¿ty fury, you may be glad to beg the Prophets prayers on your behalf for mercy.</p>
               <p>Something appeares like this now in our dayes and it's to be feared more will follow: this I am Å¿ure of, the people of God had gone a great way further then they have in deÅ¿troying the remainders of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> and AntichriÅ¿t among us, and had ere this time taken away the antient political bounds that hindred the people from going up to <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> to worÅ¿hip, had not Å¿omething hindered. CurÅ¿ed be thoÅ¿e <hi>Achitophels,</hi> whoÅ¿e pernicious counÅ¿els have hindered the Son of <hi>David</hi> from raigning; but this is our comfort, that whoÅ¿oever they be, they Å¿hall but hinder for a Å¿eaÅ¿on; when the appointed time comes, will they, nill they, they Å¿hall be removed, and ChriÅ¿t will take to himÅ¿elf his great power, and raign in the midÅ¿t of his people.

               <head>Aggravations of <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Å¿in.</head>
               <p>Secondly, conÅ¿ider the aggravations of this mans (<hi>Iehu</hi>'s) Å¿in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thoÅ¿e that went before him: they are great and many.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Iehu</hi> had the <hi>example of the wrath of God upon three Kings before him, for the Å¿ame Å¿ins. Ieroboam</hi> firÅ¿t committed this Å¿in, but had no preÅ¿idents of the warth of God to Å¿care him: it's true, he had preÅ¿idents good and many of the wrath of God upon Idolaters; but the temptation under which he lay, <hi>the fear of loÅ¿ing his Kingdom,</hi> made him to think that good and righteous end of Å¿ecuring his Kingdom and making good the word of the Lord in eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing it to himÅ¿elf would bear him out. But <hi>Iehu</hi> had no excuÅ¿e at all, but the perverÅ¿e unbelief of his own hard heart, and the wicked ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his Å¿oul; for he Å¿aw that notwithÅ¿tanding the plauÅ¿ible (and in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure righteous) pretence of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> the wrath of God conÅ¿umed him and his houÅ¿e; he had the preÅ¿idents of the wrath of God upon <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the inventer, and <hi>BaaÅ¿ha</hi> the follower of theÅ¿e Å¿ins, in Å¿uch a terrible manner, as to cut them off from the face of the earth:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118848:16"/>
and he executes the Å¿evere vengeance of God upon the head of a third tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿or of the Å¿ame kinde; and yet to provoke this jealous God to more and greater wrath, who but a <hi>Iehu,</hi> a heart hardened by love and mercy, could or durÅ¿t do it?</p>
               <p>Alas, how little doth the by-paÅ¿t judgements of God move our hard and flinty hearts in theÅ¿e our dayes! although the generation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, (freÅ¿h in memory) God hath made them as dung upon the face of the earth, and Å¿cattered them that they are not found, and brought them to nothing; yet we will not be warned, but we have made that which was but as a mote in their eye, a beam in our own; we have gotten into their places, and are fallen to commit adultery with their Å¿ins; and we will not depart from thoÅ¿e Å¿ins that have made God Å¿o terrible to them and to do Å¿uch wonders in our dayes, to the dying his garments red in blood. Who durÅ¿t do thus but thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e hearts are made fat, eyes blinde, and ears deaf, and that by mercy? as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we were a people <hi>fatted for Å¿laughter, and prepared for utter deÅ¿truction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another aggravation of this Å¿in, was this <hi>he had an enlightned conÅ¿cience:</hi> Å¿o much light, as that he could bring the word of God to confirm every action of his. And certainly he knew much of the minde of God, he was much acquainted both with the promiÅ¿es and propheÅ¿ies of God to and concerning his people, as the Å¿tory through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Å¿ufficiently evidences; he had Å¿o much light and knowledge that God did juÅ¿tly expect he Å¿hould walk in his law <hi>with all his heart,</hi> verÅ¿. 31. (but his heart, his heart was faulty; O that little thing within us, hath more deceit in it, then a whole world of other creatures have) his light enabled him to make the moÅ¿t glorious profeÅ¿Å¿ion that ever any King of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> did (that we read of) Å¿ince <hi>Solomons</hi> daies; his light made him bold, couragious, and full of outward zeal; yet againÅ¿t all this he Å¿ins: when Å¿o much of the work was done, as that he could Å¿it down and taÅ¿te the Å¿weetneÅ¿s of preÅ¿ent enjoyments, though mutable and earthly; his heart waxes fat preÅ¿ently, and could go no further; his light goes out, and he becomes blinde at noon-day: the Å¿ight of the glory of an earthly kingdom (though none had more experience of the uncertainty, vanity and vexation of Å¿pirit, that the greateÅ¿t glories here below yield; yet that) takes him, and he is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and beÅ¿otted Å¿o, as that he cannot Å¿tir one foot from it; his heart is glued to it, and he commits Idolatry, worÅ¿hips the devil, that he may enjoy it: all his work now is to endeavour to maintain what he hath got. But <hi>Iehu,</hi> it's but for a little while thou canÅ¿t keep it.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118848:16"/>
Here he takes up his abiding place, and gives all to underÅ¿tand <hi>he can live by faith no longer, he muÅ¿t now live by Å¿enÅ¿e.</hi> How many of Å¿uch <hi>Jehu</hi>'s have we in theÅ¿e our dayes? rather then the loÅ¿s of their mammon (their belly-gods) Å¿hall be hazarded by ChriÅ¿ts raigning over his people in the world, they will fight with Å¿word and buckler againÅ¿t him, and do what in them lies to hinder him. ThoÅ¿e that have formerly preached up the kingdom of ChriÅ¿t, Å¿ounded the alarms to prepare for his coming, having now joyned themÅ¿elves to the powers of this world turne their note, and begin to tell another tale;<note place="margin">WitneÅ¿s the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Å¿ent to the <hi>Norfolk</hi>-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters.</note> headily and injuriouÅ¿ly charging the people of God with things that are not true, falÅ¿ities; <hi>but their folly Å¿hall be made manifeÅ¿t to all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider, I pray, how neer this comes to AntichriÅ¿t's making merchandiÅ¿e of Å¿ouls. <hi>Let our Jehu's look to it; God will remember them in the day of his accounts, when he makes enquiry for blood; and out of their own mouth they Å¿hall be condemned, in that they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

and executed the judgements written againÅ¿t others, and committed folly with the Å¿ame Å¿ins themÅ¿elves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Another Aggravation of <hi>Iehu</hi>'s Å¿in lies in this, <hi>in that God did honour him with that Å¿pecial anointing, by a Å¿pecial meÅ¿Å¿enger, as he did none of the Kings of IÅ¿rael beÅ¿ide Å¿ince Solomon's days;</hi> no, not <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> Indeed God Å¿ent a meÅ¿Å¿enger to <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> to tell him what he would do for him; but he was not anointed, as <hi>Iehu</hi> was. One Tyrant Å¿lew another, and uÅ¿urp'd the Kingdom to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves; but none was anointed but <hi>Iehu:</hi> he was anointed to do the Lords work; yet, againÅ¿t this Anointing againÅ¿t this Å¿pecial teÅ¿timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God, did <hi>Iehu</hi> Å¿in. O ungrateful <hi>Iehu!</hi> But God will reward thee according to thy works.</p>
               <p>Can we Å¿hift this Aggravation alÅ¿o off from our Å¿elves? What Anointings hath God anointed us with! What Å¿pecial and Å¿ignal Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿timonies hath he given, of his being with us, giving us CommiÅ¿Å¿ion to do his work, and being well pleaÅ¿ed with us for obeying his voice? witneÅ¿s <hi>NaÅ¿eby, Dunbar</hi> and <hi>WorceÅ¿ter,</hi> beÅ¿ides many other. Read over the Story of our times, and Å¿ee if ever God dealt Å¿o Å¿ignally-gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouÅ¿ly with any people Å¿ince IÅ¿rael's time. Yet, againÅ¿t all this do we Å¿in: for the preÅ¿ent, our hearts like the Å¿tony ground, received them with joy; and how full of reÅ¿olutions were we to do for God, and to the glorifying of his Name, by following him fully whitherÅ¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he would lead us; but loe, how Å¿oon are we turned out of the way? we are Å¿itting Å¿till, building cieled houÅ¿es for our Å¿elves, and making, Å¿ure the kingdom, that it return not from us to the Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> though God hath Å¿aid, that <hi>though the heathen rag, and the people imagine a vain thing and Kings and Rulers take counÅ¿el to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againÅ¿t his anointed, laughing them to Å¿corn, and having them in deriÅ¿ion, he will yet Å¿et his King upon his holy hill of Sin on, and give him the utmoÅ¿t ends of the earth for his poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion: O kiÅ¿s the Son, leÅ¿t he be angry, and ye periÅ¿h in the way when his wrath is kindled but a little.</hi> If a little wrath will periÅ¿h you, what ruine will that great wrath which you deÅ¿erve bring Å¿peedily upon you, if you prevent it not by a timely repentance?</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth aggravation of <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Å¿in was this: <hi>He was anointed King of the people of the Lord.</hi> This people were the Lords people, and he was their God; &amp; God Å¿et this <hi>Iehu</hi> ruler over this his people. If they be the Lords people, and the Lord be their God, then he onely muÅ¿t he worÅ¿hipped, and Å¿erved, and feared by them; they muÅ¿t bow down to no other Gods but him; they muÅ¿t Å¿erve him in his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118848:17"/>
not by any inventions of their own; they muÅ¿t worÅ¿hip him in the place where he will be worÅ¿hipped, not upon the Altars of mens deviÅ¿ing at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel:</hi> If the people of the Lord, they muÅ¿t walk in the Lords Wayes, obey his Laws, Precepts and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and no other. All this, and much more, is intimated in theÅ¿e words, <hi>The people of the Lord.</hi> And this manner of expreÅ¿Å¿ion of the Prophet to <hi>Jehu,</hi> did intimate to him, that God did expect that he Å¿hould lead the people on to the performing of all this. God had made him the leader of his choÅ¿en ones, and now he expected that he Å¿hould lead them in the wayes God had choÅ¿en to communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf in.</p>
               <p>QueÅ¿t. <hi>Now, what benefit is this to Jehu to be King over the</hi> people of the Lord, <hi>more then over any other people?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> Truely it's a very great benefit: for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He was in a very fair way to the fulleÅ¿t enjoyment of God (attainable) on this Å¿ide heaven, in his own appointments, his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances; for being made ruler over the Lords people, had he made <hi>Solomons</hi> prayer, he Å¿hould have had <hi>Solomons</hi> return and had been a ruler after Gods own heart as <hi>David</hi> was, and Å¿o have been made partaker of <hi>Davids</hi> full enjoyments of God in his Ordinances: But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be a ruler over the Lords people, it's of great advantage; for what was he not able to do by their mighty power and force in faith and prayer? If we look into the Scripture, and Å¿ee what wonderful things have been done by the faith and prayers of the Lords people, we cannot but Å¿ay of a truth, <hi>Iehu</hi> had as great an advantage to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Å¿econd <hi>Solomon</hi> for wiÅ¿dom; (not State-policy) a Å¿econd <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> for valour and might in conquering enemies, as ever man had. It's more to be ruler over the Lords people, then to be Emperor of the whole world beÅ¿ides: to be ruler over the Lords people, that have the mighty and faithful God Å¿o neerly and Å¿trongly tied and bound to them, by Å¿o many, great, irrevocable and infallible promiÅ¿es, as he hath made to them in his word, and hath Å¿o often Å¿worn the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and truth of them with the higheÅ¿t and greateÅ¿t oath: a people that have done (and are Å¿till able to do) Å¿uch mighty and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things by faith and prayer, yea, had done Å¿uch great wonders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this <hi>Iehu</hi>'s eyes: witneÅ¿s the acts of <hi>Elijah. EliÅ¿ha,</hi> and many other of the Lords Prophets in thoÅ¿e dayes; to be ruler over Å¿uch a people, what greater thing could be done for a man on earth? what greater advantage over the world could be given to him?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:118848:18"/>Yet againÅ¿t all this <hi>Jehu</hi> Å¿ins: though God made him ruler over his people, to theÅ¿e and theÅ¿e ends and purpoÅ¿es, and thereby gives him Å¿o many and great advantages, yet he Å¿teers a contrary courÅ¿e: in Å¿tead of leading the people to <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> to worÅ¿hip, he leads them to his calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel;</hi> inÅ¿tead of pulling down all thoÅ¿e inventions of their own, which provoked God to Å¿o great wrath, he pulls down onely thoÅ¿e new &amp; more groÅ¿s inventions, which he could with no credit, nor any the leaÅ¿t Å¿hadow of conÅ¿cience keep up: but the old, ancient, fundamental bounds and limits of an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous kingdom, (<hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Å¿ins) they muÅ¿t Å¿tand Å¿till, and keep the people of God from going up to <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> to worÅ¿hip, from behaving themÅ¿elves like the Lords people, when God had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himÅ¿elf Å¿o like a gracious God towards them; they muÅ¿t Å¿tand Å¿till, for the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on and upon the Å¿ame account they were firÅ¿t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
               <p>All that God had done for <hi>Jehu,</hi> did not convince his dark minde, nor his hard Idolatrous heart, of the folly of thoÅ¿e things, and the reaÅ¿on on which they were founded; nor of the equity Å¿afety, happineÅ¿s, honour and glory, that there was in (and to be found in) obeying the will of the Lord in leading his people up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem</hi> to worÅ¿hip, in Gods own appointments.</p>
               <p>Now truely we need not <hi>Diogenes</hi> lantern and candle to finde out that man, whom God hath made taller by the head and Å¿houlders, then the reÅ¿t of his brethren, and made leader of his people in this our day; who hath led the people of the Lord on proÅ¿perouÅ¿ly to the deÅ¿truction of our <hi>Ahabs,</hi> &amp;c. on whom the eyes of the Lords people have been fixed, even to high and great expectations of the performance of many vows and promiÅ¿es: and when we have found him, Å¿hall we not Å¿ee him taking up his Å¿tation among the calves, thoÅ¿e antient inventions (that our fore-Fathers found out to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Idolatrous-kingdom) and making them his own? and if Å¿o, will he not make that great wrath and puniÅ¿hment God hath Å¿o often entail'd upon them, his own too? Å¿hall we not behold him leading the people back again into thoÅ¿e wayes, to redeem his people out of which God hath made bare Å¿uch a mighty arm of power and providence? and it's my prayer, that our eager marching back towards <hi>Egypt</hi> may not hurry us to the brink of the red-Å¿ea, ere we make a Å¿tand.</p>
               <p>A Å¿ixth aggravation of <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Å¿in was, <hi>His deceiving Gods expectations: But Jehu took no heed to walk in the way of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118848:18"/>
Lord God of IÅ¿rael with all his heart.</hi> Saith God, I have done thus and thus for <hi>Jehu,</hi> anointed him King over IÅ¿rael, honoured him in executing my judgements upon mine enemies by him: and becauÅ¿e he hath done all that was in my heart againÅ¿t the houÅ¿e of <hi>Ahab,</hi> mine, and my peoples enemies; I have given him the kingdom, and now I expected he Å¿hould have brought forth fruit anÅ¿werable to my kindneÅ¿s with all his heart: <hi>But Jehu took no heed to that.</hi> Will not the loving kindneÅ¿s of thy God work upon thee, O <hi>Jehu?</hi> what will then? Love in its effects is like the Sun, it either Å¿oftens or hardens; one of theÅ¿e two are the inÅ¿eparable effects of its influences. Whether wilt thou be hardened with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and drowned in the Red-Å¿ea, or Å¿oftened with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and have thy dayes prolonged? canÅ¿t thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the goodneÅ¿s of God to thee, and bring forth no hearty fruit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿werable to his expectations, but deceive him totally? <hi>Well, Jehu, thou wilt repent of this when it is too late, I fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How have we in our dayes been guilty of this deceiving the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our God, in not (in any meaÅ¿ure) anÅ¿wering the mercies of our God? What returnes have we made to him for his mercy at <hi>NaÅ¿eby, Dunbar, WorceÅ¿ter,</hi> and many other places? Yea, Å¿uch is the deceit and hypocriÅ¿ie of our hearts, that we cannot tell how to perform thoÅ¿e <hi>LITTLE VOWES</hi> that the glory of thoÅ¿e mercies extorted from us in the preÅ¿ent raviÅ¿hment of our hearts with their glorious beauty. The</p>
               <p>Seventh and laÅ¿t aggravation of <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Å¿in is neceÅ¿Å¿arily implied in the words, that it <hi>was againÅ¿t all the faith and prayers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</hi> Can it be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed that Å¿uch a man as <hi>Jehu</hi> was, Å¿o full of holy profeÅ¿Å¿ion, Å¿o outwardly zealous for God and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his word, who would not have one tittle of it fall to the ground; Å¿hould not Å¿uch a man as this have a large-Å¿hare in the hearts of Gods people, and Å¿o in their faith and prayer? and yet to deceive them, and Å¿in againÅ¿t theÅ¿e! What mighty Å¿ins were theÅ¿e Å¿ins of <hi>Jehu</hi>'s, guilty of Å¿uch aggravations?

to God. Why? if they did, they muÅ¿t loÅ¿e their kingdom, and that they would not do; they loved their outward concernments better then their God; and therefore rather then hazard the loÅ¿s of them, (although it was but in appearance to their dim eyes) they would let God go whither he would for them; they would have none of him. But this coÅ¿t them dear at laÅ¿t, yea, this Å¿ame reaÅ¿on wrought Å¿o Å¿trongly upon IÅ¿rael's <hi>Iehu</hi> (that enlightened man, whoÅ¿e eyes pierced the confines of heaven, and Å¿aw glories, which are not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of every common eye) that it blinded him Å¿o, that he could not Å¿tep over the Å¿tumbling-block, <hi>the fear of loÅ¿ing his kingdom;</hi> yea, if this vanity take but a little place in the hearts of the true children of God, it draws them at a diÅ¿tance from him, as is plain the caÅ¿e of <hi>AÅ¿a:</hi> when through policy he would go and hire the <hi>Syrians</hi> it Å¿mothered the faith that acted in him before, to the deÅ¿truction of <hi>Zerah</hi> the mighty <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> it drew him from his confidence and truÅ¿ting in the Lord, as the Prophet Å¿aith; and many diÅ¿honorings of the Lord followed upon it, as the Å¿tory evidences.</p>

What affliction brought it upon good <hi>IehoÅ¿aphat,</hi> whoÅ¿e policy made him joyne with <hi>Ahab!</hi> it brought him into great danger of his life, and drew down wrath upon his own head.</p>

It's worthy our obÅ¿ervation, <hi>That Jehu never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward made uÅ¿e (as we read) of thoÅ¿e Prophets of the Lord that anointed him, that firÅ¿t did his work for him, and help'd him to his power by which he got the throne.</hi> When they had done Å¿o much (as he could expect from them knowing their principles were not Å¿uitable to his deÅ¿ign) farewel then, he had no more to Å¿ay to them, their hearts were too honeÅ¿t, and brains too Å¿hallow, for his deep politick deÅ¿igns; they would walk anÅ¿werable to their profeÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (the glory of which affected the peoples hearts) perform all their promiÅ¿es and engagements: but theÅ¿e things Å¿tood not with <hi>Jehu</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t, therefore no more of them; adieu thoÅ¿e half-witted fellows, whoÅ¿e conÅ¿cience cannot Å¿wallow a lye Å¿ealed with the higheÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that by Å¿uch fine Å¿lights of State-wiÅ¿dom we may clime the Å¿teps of honor: But come thou, <hi>Jehonadab,</hi> thou art a righteous perÅ¿on, and haÅ¿t more wiÅ¿dom then <hi>Myriads</hi> of thoÅ¿e Idiots. And indeed, what can you expect more from a <hi>Jehu,</hi> who Å¿ets up an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t contrary to God's? never expect friendÅ¿hip or friendly dealing from him, till God hath changed his heart, and of a <hi>Jehu</hi> made him a <hi>David;</hi> of a <hi>Saul</hi> a <hi>Paul.</hi> ConÅ¿ider <hi>Jehonadab</hi> a little further, then judge. He was one that came to meet <hi>Jehu</hi> when he had made a Å¿ure progreÅ¿s in his work; he was not at the beginning among the Prophets of the Lord to Å¿trengthen <hi>Jehu</hi>'s hand in the work; no, but when he had Å¿lain the King and <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and by a wile deÅ¿troyed the Kings Å¿eventy Å¿ons, and was going with power Å¿ufficient to make a full end of all his enemies, Then comes (good) <hi>Iehonadab,</hi> to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate <hi>Iehu,</hi> to have a finger i'the pye before it's put i'the oven. And <hi>Iehu</hi> he Å¿trikes in with this holy man, and engages him (eaÅ¿ily enough, poor Å¿oul) to be on his Å¿ide: <hi>Iehu</hi> knew full well, that this wary wiÅ¿e man (that knew the way to Å¿leep in a whole skin, till <hi>Iehu</hi> had almoÅ¿t made Å¿ure work, and then comes and proffers his congratulatory Å¿ervice to his greatneÅ¿s) would be a fitter inÅ¿trument for his turn, then thoÅ¿e hardy Å¿imple-hearted fellows, (the Prophets of the Lord) that, to fulfil the minde of God, would run through Å¿uch hazards and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (as they did) to lift up <hi>Iehu</hi> into a capacity to do the will of God. It's this <hi>Iehonadab</hi> that <hi>Iehu</hi> is Å¿o eager to engage. (The

text Å¿aith, he [lighted] on him, like a bird of prey, and with his tallons he hoiÅ¿ted him up into the chariot, a high place, that diz'd poor <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab</hi>'s brains Å¿o, as they could never get into their right poÅ¿ture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.) And what Å¿weet complements paÅ¿t between them? his whole diÅ¿courÅ¿e was about Å¿incerity and uprightneÅ¿s of heart, when (God knows) it was that he leaÅ¿t cared for; but <hi>Jehonadab</hi> underÅ¿tood him well enough, and knew what counÅ¿el would pleaÅ¿e (as appears in the matter of <hi>Baals</hi> PrieÅ¿ts.) <hi>It's this Jehonadab that Jehu loves and hugs in his boÅ¿ome: for you, the Lords people, who have not a Jehonadab's wiÅ¿dom farewel: he will have no more to do with you, Å¿uch fanatick Å¿illy fellows, that are good for nothing, but to ruine a State.</hi> As we cannot finde it in the Å¿tory that <hi>Jehu</hi> took any friendly notice of the Lords people (to whom he was Å¿o much engaged) after he came to the Throne; Å¿o we Å¿hall never finde it in experience, that a <hi>Jehu</hi> will be a friend indeed, to thoÅ¿e who in Å¿incerity of heart look <hi>Sion</hi>-ward.</p>

From hence the Saints and people of God may Å¿ee what their work is, <hi>To bear the croÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t, in bearing witneÅ¿s againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e deviations and apoÅ¿tacies, that are too too likely to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run this generation of men;</hi> &amp; to Å¿eek after the Lamb, the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, for their Leader, and follow him whitherÅ¿oever he will lead them: there's no doubt nor QueÅ¿tion to be made, but his deÅ¿ignes are right, and adequate to the will of his Father, who hath promiÅ¿ed him the throne of his father <hi>David.</hi>
